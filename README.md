# Metatagging Data for a Quantum Universe

![Quantum Universe Banner](entangled.png)

This repository explores metadata-driven frameworks for conceptualizing and interacting with quantum phenomena. Drawing inspiration from both classical 3D vector space tagging and advanced quantum theories, this project aims to bridge the gap between physics, computation, and metadata engineering.

#### 🚀 Key Features

- **Meta-Tagging for Quantum Entities**
  Encode metadata for particles, including quantum state, entanglement, and interaction rules.

- **Dynamic 3D Vectorspace Modeling**
  Scalable models integrating metadata at Planck-scale resolution, forming a computational framework for quantum interactions.

- **Unified Theoretical Approach**
  Combine principles of quantum mechanics, general relativity, and computational tagging to simulate a metadata-driven universe.

#### 🌌 Expansion of the 3D Vector Space

The 3D vector space expansion framework allows for a detailed and scalable representation of quantum phenomena. This includes:

- **Planck-Scale Representation**: The vector space is divided into units at the Planck scale to capture the smallest physical details of quantum entities.
- **Temporal and Interaction-Driven Expansion**: The vector space evolves dynamically in response to changes in quantum states and interactions over time.
- **Mathematical Modeling**: Employ linear algebra techniques and metadata encoding to represent quantum phenomena computationally.

For more information, refer to the detailed documentation in [3D Vector Space Expansion](3d_vectorspace_expansion.md).

#### 📚 Applications

- **Quantum Simulations**
  Simulate particle behavior (e.g., superposition and entanglement) using metadata encoding techniques.

- **Physics-Based AI Systems**
  Build AI systems that interpret and manipulate metadata for dynamic interactions in quantum and classical physics.

- **Game Development & AR/VR**
  Use meta-tagging to enhance interactivity, rendering, and environmental behavior in virtual environments.
